				<p style="text-align:justify">
					American Academy of Periodontology launched an effort to educate the public about new findings which support
					what dental professionals had long suspected: Infections in the mouth can play havoc elsewhere in the body.
					For a long time it was thought that bacteria was the factor that linked periodontal disease to other
					infections in the body, however, new research demonstrates that inflammation may link periodontal disease to
					other chronic conditions.
					<br><br>
					Research has shown, and experts agree, that there is an association between periodontal diseases and other
					chronic inflammatory conditions, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer’s disease. Therefore,
					treating inflammation may not only help manage periodontal diseases but may also help with the management of
					other chronic inflammatory conditions.
					<br><br>
					When an inflammatory condition is suspected or diagnosed, it is important to consult with both a general
					physician and a dental health professional, such as periodontics. Sometimes the only way to detect periodontal
					diseases is through a periodontal evaluation. A periodontal evaluation may be especially important if you:
					<br><br>
					Have a high risk for periodontal diseases. Take the AAP risk assessment test.
					<br><br>
					Have heart disease, diabetes, respiratory disease or osteoporosis, or are thinking of becoming pregnant. Have
					a family member with periodontal disease. Research suggests that the bacteria that cause periodontal disease
					can pass through saliva. This means the common contact of saliva in families puts children and couples at risk
					for contracting the periodontal disease of another family member.
					<br><br>
					Have a sore or irritation in your mouth that does not get better within two weeks.
					<br><br>
				<h3><span>Gum Disease and Diabetes</span></h3>
				People with diabetes are more likely to have periodontal disease than people without diabetes, probably because
				diabetics are more susceptible to contracting infections. In fact, periodontal disease is often considered the
				sixth complication of diabetes. Those people who don't have their diabetes under control are especially at risk.
				Severe periodontal disease can increase blood sugar, contributing to increased periods of time when the body
				functions with a high blood sugar. This puts diabetics at increased risk for diabetic complications.
				<br><br>
				<h3><span>Gum Disease and Osteoporosis</span></h3>
				Researchers have suggested that a link between osteoporosis and bone loss in the jaw. Studies suggest that
				osteoporosis may lead to tooth loss because the density of the bone that supports the teeth may be decreased,
				which means the teeth no longer have a solid foundation. However, hormone replacement therapy may offer some
				protection
				<br><br>
				<h3><span>Gum Disease and Pregnancy Problems</span></h3>
				Now evidence is mounting that suggests a new risk factor – periodontal disease. Pregnant women who have
				periodontal disease may be seven times more likely to have a baby that is born too early and too small. More
				research is needed to confirm how periodontal disease may affect pregnancy outcomes. It appears that periodontal
				disease triggers increased levels of biological fluids that induce labor. Furthermore, data suggests that women
				whose periodontal condition worsens during pregnancy have an even higher risk of having a premature baby.
				<h3><span>Gum Disease Links to Heart Disease and Stroke</span></h3>
				<br><br>
				<h3>Heart Disease</h3>
				Several theories exist to explain the link between periodontal disease and heart disease. One theory is that
				oral bacteria can affect the heart when they enter the blood stream, attaching to fatty plaques in the coronary
				arteries (heart blood vessels) and contributing to clot formation. Coronary artery disease is characterized by a
				thickening of the walls of the coronary arteries due to the buildup of fatty proteins. Blood clots can obstruct
				normal blood flow, restricting the amount of nutrients and oxygen required for the heart to function properly.
				This may lead to heart attacks.
				<br><br>
				Another possibility is that the inflammations caused by periodontal disease increases plaque buildup, which may
				contribute to swelling of the arteries.
				<br><br>
				Researchers have found that people with periodontal disease are almost twice as likely to suffer from coronary
				artery disease as those without periodontal disease.
				<br><br>
				Periodontal disease can also exacerbate existing heart conditions. Patients at risk for infective endocarditic
				may require antibiotics prior to dental procedures. Your Periodontic and cardiologist will be able to determine
				if your heart condition requires use of antibiotics prior to dental procedures.
				<br><br>
				<h3>Stroke</h3>
				Additional studies have pointed to a relationship between periodontal disease and stroke. In one study that
				looked at the causal relationship of oral infection as a risk factor for stroke, people diagnosed with acute
				cerebrovascular ischemia were found more likely to have an oral infection when compared to those in the control
				group.
