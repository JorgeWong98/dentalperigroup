                        <p>A dental implant is an artificial tooth root that a periodontist places into your jaw to hold a replacement tooth implante or bridge. Dental implants are an ideal option for people in good general oral health who have lost a tooth or teeth due to periodontal disease, an injury, or some other reason.
                        <br><br>
                        While high-tech in nature, dental implants are actually more tooth-saving than traditional bridgework, since implants do not rely on neighboring teeth for support.
                        <br><br>
                        Dental implants are so natural-looking and feeling, you may forget you ever lost a tooth.You know that your confidence about your teeth affects how you feel about yourself, both personally and professionally. Perhaps you hide your smile because of spaces from missing teeth. Maybe your dentures don't feel secure.
                        <br><br>
                        Perhaps you have difficulty chewing. If you are missing one or more teeth and would like to smile, speak and eat again with comfort and confidence, there is good news! Dental implants are teeth that can look and feel just like your own! Under proper conditions, such as placement by a periodontist and diligent patient maintenance, implants can last a lifetime. Long-term studies continue to show improving success rates for implants.</p>

                       <h3><span>Endosteal (in the bone):</span></h3>

                   <p>This is the most commonly used type of implant. The various types include screws, cylinders or blades surgically placed into the jawbone. Each implant holds one or more prosthetic teeth. This type of implant is generally used as an alternative for patients with bridges or removable dentures.</p>

                       <h3><span>Subperiosteal (on the bone):</span></h3>

                    <p>These are placed on top of the jaw with the metal framework's posts protruding through the gum to hold the prosthesis. These types of implants are used for patients who are unable to wear conventional dentures and who have minimal bone height.</p>

                <p>Every way you look at it, dental implants are a better solution to the problem of missing teeth.</p>

Since dental implants integrate into the structure of your bone, they prevent the bone loss and gum recession that often accompany bridgework and dentures. No one will ever know that you have a replacement tooth.</p>

                <p>Dental implants don't sacrifice the quality of your adjacent teeth like a bridge does because neighboring teeth are not altered to support the implant. More of your own teeth are left untouched, a significant long-term benefit to your oral health!</p>

                <p>Dental implants will allow you to once again speak and eat with comfort and confidence! They are secure and offer freedom from the irksome clicks and wobbles of dentures. They'll allow you to say goodbye to worries about misplaced dentures and messy pastes and glues.</p>

                    <p>The ideal candidate for a dental implant is in good general and oral health. Adequate bone in your jaw is needed to support the implant, and the best candidates have healthy gum tissues that are free of periodontal disease.
                    <br>
                    Dental implants are intimately connected with the gum tissues and underlying bone in the mouth. Since periodontists are the dental experts who specialize in precisely these areas, they are ideal members of your dental implant team. Not only do periodontists have experience working with other dental professionals, they also have the special knowledge, training and facilities that you need to have teeth that look and feel just like your own. Your dentist and periodontist will work together to make your dreams come true.</p>

            <p>This procedure is a team effort between you, your dentist and your periodontist. Your periodontist and dentist will consult with you to determine where and how your implant should be placed. Depending on your specific condition and the type of implant chosen, your periodontist will create a treatment plan tailored to meet your needs. Click for more information about the treatment options described below.

            <h3><span>Replacing Several Teeth</span></h3>
            <p>If you are missing several teeth, implant-supported bridges can replace them. Dental implants will replace both your lost natural teeth and some of the roots.</p>

            <h3><span>Replacing All of Your Teeth</span></h3>
            <p>If you are missing all of your teeth, an implant-supported full bridge or full denture can replace them. Dental implants will replace both your lost natural teeth and some of the roots.</p>
            
            <h3><span>Sinus Augmentation</span></h3><p>
            A key to implant success is the quantity and quality of the bone where the implant is to be placed. The upper back jaw has traditionally been one of the most difficult areas to successfully place dental implants due to insufficient bone quantity and quality and the close proximity to the sinus. Sinus augmentation can help correct this problem by raising the sinus floor and developing bone for the placement of dental implants.</p>

            <h3><span>Ridge Modification</span></h3>
            <p>Deformities in the upper or lower jaw can leave you with inadequate bone in which to place dental implants. To correct the problem, the gum is lifted away from the ridge to expose the bony defect. The defect is then filled with bone or bone substitute to build up the ridge. Ridge modification has been shown to greatly improve appearance and increase your chances for successful implants that can last for years to come.</p>

                <p>Do not disturb the wound. Avoid rinsing, spitting or touching the wound on the day of surgery. There will be a metal healing abutment protruding through the gingival (gum) tissue.</p>
                
                <h3><span>Bleeding</span></h3>
                <p>Some bleeding or redness in the saliva is normal for 24 hours. Excessive bleeding (your mouth fills up rapidly with blood) can be controlled by biting on a gauze pad placed directly on the bleeding wound for 30 minutes. If bleeding continues please call for further instructions.</p>
                
                <h3><span>Swelling</span></h3>
                <p>Swelling is a normal occurrence after surgery. To minimize swelling, apply an ice bag, or a plastic bag, or towel filled with ice on the cheek in the area of surgery. Apply the ice continuously, as much as possible, for the first 36 hours.</p>
                
                <h3><span>Diet</span></h3>
                <p>Drink plenty of fluids. Avoid hot liquids, spicy, fat and hot food. Soft food and liquids should be eaten on the day of surgery. Return to a normal diet as soon as possible unless otherwise directed.</p>
                
                <h3><span>Pain and Antibiotics</span></h3>
                <p>Be sure to take the prescribed pain medication and antibiotics as directed to help prevent infections.</p>
                
                <h3><span>Oral hygiene</span></h3>
                <p>Good oral hygiene is essential to good healing. After breakfast and before sleep. Be sure to rinse for at least 30 seconds then spit it out, and do not eat, drink or rinse in the next 30 minutes. You have to buy  a extra soft brush teeth, do not touch where the stitches are.</p>
                
                <h3><span>Activity</span></h3>
                <p>Keep physical activities to a minimum immediately following surgery, if you are considering exercise, throbbing or bleeding may occur. If this occurs, you should discontinue exercising. Keep in mind that you are probably not taking normal nourishment. This may weaken you and further limit your ability to exercise. Do not expose to high temperatures (oven, machines, iron, stove) etc.</p>
                
                <h3><span>Wearing your prosthesis</span></h3>
                <p>Partial dentures, flippers, or full dentures should not be used immediately after surgery and for at least 10 days. This was discussed in the pre-operative consultation.</p>
